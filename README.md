Frame orientation constraint created by Simon Jeng

This is a repository created by Simon Jeng to make a custom constraint in OpenSim Moco. This constraint is of MocoPathConstraint class, and constrains the relative angle between two frames. The constraint was developed for two-dimensional model in the sagittal plane (the plane perpendicular to the z axis, exactly).

This is the first time for me to pull requests in Github. If more information is required, pleas let me know.

Thanks,
Simon Jeng
